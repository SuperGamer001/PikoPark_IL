# PikoPark_IL (STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS!!!)
This is my remake of Piko Park.

This game hardly has anything. The players aren't even there. There is hardly any JavaScript. I'm trying to add Controller support to my game through one of my tools, [Gamepad.js](https://github.com/SuperGamer001/Gamepad.js). I'm also trying to fix the title screen.
